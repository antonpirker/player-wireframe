# Music Player

This is a proof of concept of a very simple music player. On the main screen you see nine random icons that represent nine different play lists. You can choose one playlist and you see the songs in the playlist. If you click on the album art image in the center you start or stop playback of that song. You can skip to the next/previous song by clicking on the left or right album art image. That's it.

## Background

I have a eleven months old girl and I was thinking how she will listen to music when she is older? When I was young we had cassette and CD players, which had a really great physical way of playing music.

In our home we have right now only two Sonos that are remote controlled with a app on a smart phone. Which is a really annoying and boring way of playing music.

There are some really cool physical music projects out there (see below). I was thinking about building one myself but because I have a little girl, I know I will never finish a project of this magnitude.

So I tried a different approach. Creating a very simple music player for a tablet/smartphone. Currently it is just a click dummy. If one of you would implement the rest that would be awesome (The rest would be: a way to define playlists in Google Play Music, Spotify or whatever, a mechanism to download all the music to the tablet/smartphone, a way to play and stop it.)


## Alternatives

A really great commercial product for physically playing music and listening to stories for kids is called Tonies.

There is also another project done by Jordi Parra that made Spotify playlist physical again.
